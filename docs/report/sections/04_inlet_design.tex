\chapter{Supersonic Inlet Design}

\section{Design Inputs}

The inlet is designed for the following flight and design conditions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Freestream Mach number: \( M_1 = 3.2 \)
    \item Ratio of specific heats: \( \gamma = 1.4 \)
    \item Number of oblique shocks: 3
    \item Upstream Mach number before terminal normal shock: \( M_n = 1.3 \)
\end{itemize}

\section{Oblique Shock Solution}

Application of the Oswatitsch equal-strength condition resulted in a common normal Mach number across all oblique shocks of:
\[
M_n^* = 1.493
\]

The resulting shock angles, flow deflection angles, and Mach number progression through the inlet are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:oblique_results}.

\begin{table}[h]

\label{tab:oblique_results}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}
\hline
Shock & $M_i$ & $\beta_i$ (deg) & $\theta_i$ (deg) & $M_{i+1}$ \\
\hline
1 & 3.200 & 27.82 & 11.90 & 2.566 \\
2 & 2.566 & 35.60 & 14.45 & 1.950 \\
3 & 1.950 & 49.98 & 17.22 & 1.300 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The results show a smooth and monotonic reduction in Mach number through the oblique shock system, while maintaining supersonic flow prior to the terminal normal shock.

\section{Pressure Recovery}

The stagnation pressure ratio across each oblique shock was found to be identical, consistent with the equal-strength shock condition:
\[
\pi_1 = \pi_2 = \pi_3 = 0.9319
\]

The stagnation pressure ratio across the terminal normal shock was computed as:
\[
\pi_4 = 0.9794
\]

The total inlet pressure recovery is therefore:
\[
\pi_d = \prod_{i=1}^{4} \pi_i = 0.7926
\]

This value is consistent with expected pressure recovery levels for Mach 3+ external-compression inlets and confirms the effectiveness of the Oswatitsch-optimized shock system.

\section{Inlet Geometry}

A two-dimensional ramp inlet geometry corresponding to the calculated deflection angles was generated to provide a visual representation of the inlet configuration. The inlet consists of three successive compression ramps producing the required flow turning prior to the terminal normal shock. A schematic of the inlet geometry is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:inlet_geometry}.
