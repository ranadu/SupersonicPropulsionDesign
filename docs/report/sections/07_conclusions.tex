\chapter{Conclusions}

A preliminary supersonic inlet design for a Mach 3.2 commercial transport application was completed using the Oswatitsch equal-strength shock principle. A three-oblique-shock compression system followed by a terminal normal shock was successfully designed to meet the specified inlet requirements.

The resulting inlet achieves a total pressure recovery of 0.793, which is consistent with classical expectations for high-supersonic external compression inlets. The smooth Mach number reduction and absence of detached shocks indicate a physically realistic and robust inlet configuration suitable for preliminary propulsion system design.

The optimized inlet parameters obtained in this phase form the basis for the parametric cycle analysis and propulsion system trade study conducted in Part II of this project.
