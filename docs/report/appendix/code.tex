\chapter{Design Code}

All inlet design and cycle analysis calculations were performed using custom MATLAB scripts developed specifically for this project. The code is fully self-contained and may be executed by running the front-end scripts \texttt{run\_inlet\_design.m} and \texttt{run\_cycle\_analysis.m}. Supporting functions implement standard compressible flow relations and one-dimensional turbojet cycle equations.

Representative excerpts are shown below for reference.
